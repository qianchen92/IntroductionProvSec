== General Notes

This is a draft version of the course notes for the "Provable Security" course. The notes are intended to provide a comprehensive overview of the topics covered in the course, including the game-based security, simulation-based security, UC framework, and various cryptographic protocols. This document is a work in progress and will be updated as the course progresses. It is possible that there are some mistakes or typos in the notes. If you find any errors, please feel free to contact me at #link("chen.qian@sdu.edu.cn").

== Reference Books

We use the following books and papers as references for the course:
- @JACM:Canetti20: For the UC framework, we refer to the paper "Universally Composable Security" by Ran Canetti. This paper is a newer version of @FOCS:Canetti01 which first introduce the notion of $UC$ security. It provides a comprehensive overview of the UC framework and its applications in cryptography.
