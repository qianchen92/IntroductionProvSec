= Introduction

== General Notes

These notes are a draft version for the "Provable Security" course. They aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the
topics covered, including game-based security, simulation-based security, the UC framework, and various cryptographic
protocols. This document is a work in progress and will be updated throughout the course. Errors or omissions may
remain; readers are encouraged to report any issues to #link("chen.qian@sdu.edu.cn").

== Reference Books

The following books and papers serve as primary references for this course:
- @Shoup04: For the game-based security framework, we refer to "Sequences of games: a tool for taming complexity in
  security proofs" by Victor Shoup. This introduce the basic concepts of game-based security and provides a comprehensive
  overview of the framework.
- @Lindell17: For the simulation-based security framework, we refer to "How to Simulate It - A Tutorial on the Simulation
  Proof Technique" by Yehuda Lindell.
- @JACM:Canetti20: For the Universal Composability (UC) framework, we refer to "Universally Composable Security" by Ran
  Canetti. This paper is an updated version of @FOCS:Canetti01, which originally introduced the concept of UC security. It
  provides a comprehensive overview of the UC framework and its applications in cryptography.
